# To Do

## Basic Functionality

* PUT
* DB "UPDATE"

* Add Acceleration Structures for Searching
    * Searching by `tag_id` (Inverted Index)
    * Searching by `user_id` (Inverted Index)
* Fix User Code
* Correct User Session Tracking
* Tags as a Dropdown
* How to handle HTTP Errors?

### Search

* Do something good for the pre-loading of an ass-load of recipes.

### Images

* How are we doing to handle image storage?
    - maybe just file system?
    - probably individual image records within our file

## User Interface

* Add UI Limits for Fields
