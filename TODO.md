### Search

* Do something good for the pre-loading of an ass-load of recipes.

### Images

* How are we doing to handle image storage?
    - maybe just file system?
    - probably individual image records within our file

## User Interface

* Add UI Limits for Fields

```
-----------------------
| cat                 |
-----------------------
                   0/22
```

### User Stuff

* User Creation needs to be updated (for the new structure)
* User Session management needs to be updated
* New User form needs to be updated
* Login form needs to be updated
